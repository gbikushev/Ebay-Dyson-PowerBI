I received the item, but the adapter cable is defective and the product is not functioning. This raises concerns about quality control, contrary to your advertising claims. I have reached out several times for assistance but have not received a response. I noticed similar complaints about assistance in reviews, which is concerning.

I am still awaiting a reply and a replacement for the faulty cord.
